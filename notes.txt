Increases of species richness across communities tend to expand the trait space (or FRic), as the accumulation of species adds traits in the edges of the trait space.

In other words, species will pack into specific portions of the trait space, likely within a combination of traits that confer high specialization to resource acquisition and partitioning (Mouillot et al. 2014, Pigot et al. 2016).
